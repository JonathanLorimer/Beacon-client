 
# BEACON 				

Travel diaries are great for looking back on the places you have visited and reminiscing. Unfortunately they can be tedious to fill out. 
We utilize the concept of gamification and a compulsion loop to encourage users to log when they visit a location, 
and even encourage them to explore certain locations they might not have. 
The idea is that the user gains an achievement for each location they visit, and a larger acheivement for visiting all the locations in a neighbourhood. 


## Beacon was crafted with the following:

• TripAdvisor for Data
• React (versatile, powerful)
• Ruby On Rails (get off the ground quickly)
• PostgreSQL
• ReactNative (for mobile location loggin)
